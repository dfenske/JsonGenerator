# JsonGenerator
Generates valid JSON structure for mock data based on user input
<br/>
<br/>
This tool was used to streamline the process of making mock JSON data for demos of a specific project I worked on. These demos required mock data to be made to show a customer, and this mock data could consist of 20,000+ lines written in JSON, with lots of intertwined references, interdependencies, and many places where it is easy to make one typo and break everything. <em>"Oh, your device has ID 2724 but on line 18,234 you wrote 272<strong>3</strong>? Won't work! Good luck finding that line." </em> This app is meant to help create that JSON without having to actually search-and-replace, scour the big file, and spend hours fixing small typos. It can cut down a week of hassle and debugging to merely an hour or less <strong>per demo</strong>.
