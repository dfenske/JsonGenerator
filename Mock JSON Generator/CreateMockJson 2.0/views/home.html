    <h2>Why do you need this tool?</h2>
    <div class="text-left" style="width:50%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto">
        <p>This tool is meant to streamline the process of making mock JSON data for demos and PoCs. 20,000+ lines of mock data written in JSON are needed for a single PoC, with lots of intertwined references, interdependencies, and  places where it is easy to make one typo and break everything. <br /><em>"Oh, your device has id 2724 but on line 18,234 you wrote 2723? Won't work! Good luck finding that line." </em> <br />This app is meant to help create that JSON without having to actually search-and-replace, scour the big file, and spend hours fixing small typos.</p>
