        <uib-accordion close-others="false">
            <div uib-accordion-group class="panel-default" heading="Is there a specific order in which I need to create components?" is-open="true">
                YES! The order that they are listed in the form is the order they need to be created in. For example, you need an enterprise before you can create a site, and you need a site before you can create a user. You can have multiple sites before you create a user, but you need at least one site so that you can assign a site to your user.
            </div>
            <div uib-accordion-group class="panel-default" heading="How do I tell what a field requires?">
                Hover over the label for the field for more information.
            </div>
            <div uib-accordion-group class="panel-default" heading="What if I want to delete a component?">
                Click the edit button next to a component and then click the delete button below the form.
            </div>
            <div uib-accordion-group class="panel-default" heading="What is JSON?">
                JavaScript Object Notation - it is just a way of representing objects in a textual format that can be parsed by JavaScript.
            </div>

        <h3>Site</h3>
        <uib-accordion close-others="false">
            <div uib-accordion-group class="panel-default" heading="What is the address of the site used for?">
                The address of the site is where the pin will be placed on the map in the UI to represent that site - therefore it is important that it is accurate.
            </div>
            <div uib-accordion-group class="panel-default" heading="How do I input the address of the site?">
                You type in an address into the 'Address' field and click 'Show on Map'. This does a search using the Google Maps API, displays it on the map below for verification, and populates the latitude and longitude of that address. This way, you don't have to go figure out the lat/long of the address you want to choose for your site.

        <uib-accordion close-others="false">
            <div uib-accordion-group class="panel-default" heading="Why do I have to specify a supervisor?">
                The supervisor is the user that will be notified if an alert is triggered for that device.
